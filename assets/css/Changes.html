		                            Frequently, violence against women is justified by gender stereotypes. Cultural standards frequently dictate that men should be assertive, in charge, and domineering while women should be submissive, meek, and dependent on men for support. These expectations could openly encourage a culture of abuse.Gender-based violence (GBV) is still a significant problem for human rights everywhere in the globe. GBV affects one out of every three women and girls, regardless of class, race, age, sexual orientation, disability status, or culture.The solution to GBV is to ensure that victims of violence and those at risk of violence have access to comprehensive support, including high-quality medical care, psychosocial aid, judicial and legal services, safe havens, and financial aid. By donating to this cause, you can help a women or child get a safer environment.

		                            FGM is performed for a variety of sociocultural reasons that vary by place and throughout time, as well as within families and communities. FGM is frequently seen as a vital component of a girl's upbringing and a means of preparing her for adulthood and marriage. FGM is frequently motivated by ideas about what constitutes proper sexual behavior. It seeks to guarantee marital fidelity and premarital virginity.FGM is a very harmful practice that can result in long-term medical and psychological problems as well as complications during the process such heavy bleeding, and even death.We may fight to ensure their implementation and enforcement while also supporting the creation of laws and policies aimed at eliminating and prohibiting FGM. Along with rallying communities to change the societal norms that support the practice, we can also assist in ensuring that girls at risk of FGM and FGM survivors have access to appropriate care. Your contribution will support Women4Women's efforts to put an end to FGM and shield additional girls and women from the practice.

		                        <div class="cause-details">
		                            The world's girls are disproportionately affected by gender discrimination, which begins in childhood and continues to deprive children of their childhoods and limit their opportunities. A girl is much more likely to be denied her rights, prevented from attending school, coerced into marriage, and subjected to abuse - with her voice, if it is heard at all, being discounted. Additionally, this attack on infancy robs nations of the vitality and skill required for advancement.Women and girls still experience abuse and prejudice after decades of advancement.Therefore, a sociological approach offers a number of policies and actions to address the structural and cultural causes that contribute to gender inequality in order to diminish it. We may combat gender stereotyping in the news and popular media, lessen the training of children into traditional gender roles by parents and other adults, and raise public awareness of the causes, scope, and effects of rape and sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography. Aiming for gender equality benefits everyone in society, especially girls and women, and is essential as it can create peace for everyone. By donating, you are creating a world of difference in the fight against gender inequality.
